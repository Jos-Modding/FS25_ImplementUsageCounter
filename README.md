# Bale Wrap Counter

Adds a bale wrapping counter to any bale wrapper or baler that supports wrapping.
Like the basegame bale counter, this counter has a session and lifetime counter.

The session counter can be reset, however to avoid filling up your help menu, you have to set a key binding yourself through the default game settings.

Compatible with the following mods:
- FS25_roundBalerExtension (tested version 1.1.0.0)
- FS25_SwitchableBaleWrappersforBalers (tested version 1.0.0.0)
